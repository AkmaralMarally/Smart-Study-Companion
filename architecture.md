The project aims to develop a desktop-based Smart Study Companion application using Java, with a possible future extension to mobile platforms. It will assist students in managing study sessions, tracking progress, and receiving personalized recommendations. The first stage focuses on requirements analysis and UML design, followed by implementation of key features such as multi-threaded timers, data storage with SQLite, and performance visualization. Later stages will refine the interface using JavaFX/Swing, add an intelligent suggestion module, and conclude with small-scale user testing and evaluation.
