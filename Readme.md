Smart Study Companion is a study aid for university students and self-learners. 
It not only provides a timer based on the Pomodoro Technique, but also records study behavior (such as study time, number of pauses, and task completion), saves session data locally, and automatically generates study reports and personalized recommendations (such as taking breaks and adjusting study time) based on simple data analysis. The system prioritizes privacy, and all data is stored in a local database (SQLite) by default and not uploaded to the cloud.The project follows an iterative software development approach inspired by Agile principles, emphasizing gradual improvement and user feedback. 
It is designed as an ethical system that respects user privacy and focuses solely on educational enhancement.
